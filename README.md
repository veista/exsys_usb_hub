# Exsys USB Hub
Exsys Managed USB Hub integration for Home Assistant

Should support all Exsys Managed USB Hubs from 4-16 ports that use USB-Serial management. Only tested with EX-1504HMS.

This integration and a managed hub is especially handy if you have an unreliable usb device, for example Z-Wave dongle in a remote location or you want to automate its recovery.
